  ## Description
  This application is a refactor of a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API. It has been reactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. The application uses JWT authentication. It allows users to search for books. Returned book data includes title, description, authors and book image. User can sign up and once logged in they can save book searches to the back end and later remove books from their saved book list. 
  
  The application is developed using the following technologies:
  - Javascript
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB
  - Mongoose
  - React
  - GraphQL

  The main challenge in developing this application was familiarisation with GraphQL and JWT.
